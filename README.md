# Coding_Challenge-9

This coding challenge is all about **learning something on your own using your fundamental programming knowledge you have developed in this course to work with something most of you may not have had any experience with: 3D modelling**. Often times as a developer, you are asked to do things that you have no idea how to do initially. But using your ability to solve problems, you read documentation, tutorials, articles, etc, to figure it out. This is a skill that is so fundamental to being a good developer that I really tried to teach in the course. Everytime you said "ughhh Andrei, you didn't teach us enough CSS" you now know why now. Finally, this project should be a pretty nice thing to add to your portfolio and impress your future employer or client!

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites on here.

## Prizes!
Since I have been working hard on an upcoming course (release coming in October), I haven’t had time to look for sponsors, so the most creative submission to this coding challenge will get a full code review by me on any one of their projects that they choose (if that’s not an exciting prize, you will still have fun and learn a lot coding this challenge).

## What is the Challenge?
Use https://threejs.org/ to build something creative in 3D. Why this library? Because it is probably one of the coolest libraries around for javascript, but also one with the most confusing documentation (in my opinion) when you are getting started. As you go through the library you will say: "I have no idea how any of this works". Stick with it. What else can you do? Maybe google for articles, and how-tos? Slowly you will figure out how it all works and you will be creating amazing 3D objects in no time. The challenge is to really push yourself to learn and find creative ways to tackle a problem. Can't wait to see some of these submissions and showcase them on here!

## The Rules Are:

1. You HAVE TO use https://threejs.org/ but beyond that, what you build, or how you do it, is up to you. 

2. **You have until September 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution file (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the #coding-challenge Discord channel with the following message: "-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"
The bot will listen for the command and will submit the link you provided in the command. Please check that the bot responded with "Thanks for submitting your coding challenge entry!" and then double check the details it provides. Winner will be announced a couple of weeks after the contest ends.

3. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

*** **Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
